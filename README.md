# HashWalker

Software developer focused on cryptography, cybersecurity, and security research.

## Skills

Building cryptographic libraries and security tools from scratch. Experience with malware analysis, penetration testing, and low-level programming.

## Programming Languages

- **Python** - Cryptographic libraries and security tools
- **C/C++** - System programming and performance optimization  
- **Assembly** - Low-level code and reverse engineering

## Current Project: KatCrypt

Developing a pure Python cryptographic library implementing multiple block ciphers and encryption modes from scratch.

**Implemented Algorithms:**
- AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- MARS (IBM AES competition finalist)
- Threefish (Skein hash function block cipher)

**In Development:**
- Serpent block cipher

**Planned Implementations:**
- Camellia
- Twofish
- ChaCha20

**Architecture:**
- Multiple encryption modes (ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, CTR, GCM)
- Clean API design across all ciphers
- Test vectors from official standards
