# Hi! 👋 I'm HashWalker

I like programming. Currently building a comprehensive encryption library with support for a variety of ciphers.

## 🛠️ Languages I Know
- **Python** - Primary development language
- **C/C++** - Performance-critical implementations
- **Assembly** - Low-level optimization when needed

## 🔐 Current Project: JediCrypt

Building a Python cryptographic library from scratch:

**Ciphers I've implemented:**
- AES ✅

**Cipher I'm working on:**
- MARS 🚧

**Ciphers I plan to add:**
- Camellia ❌
- Serpent ❌
- Twofish ❌
- Threefish ❌

**Modes of Operation:** ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, CTR, GCM ✅  
**Design:** Modular - same modes work with all ciphers

## 🦍 Very important Fact.

100 cryptographers vs 1 gorilla? The gorilla wins every time.
